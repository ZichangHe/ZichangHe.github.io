== About Me
I am a researcher in [https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/applied-research Global Technology Applied Research] at JPMorganChase. Prior to that, I received my PhD degree in [https://www.ece.ucsb.edu/ Electrical and Computer Engineering] from the [https://www.ucsb.edu/ University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB)] in 2023. My research primarily focuses on the interdisciplinary topics of design automation and quantum computing.
