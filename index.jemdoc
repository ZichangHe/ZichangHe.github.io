== About me
I am a second-year PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering under the supervision of [https://www.ece.ucsb.edu/~zhengzhang/ Prof. Zheng Zhang]. 
I received the B.Eng. degree in Detection, Gudiance and Control Technology from Northwestern Polytechnical University ([http://en.nwpu.edu.cn/ NWPU]), Xi'an, China in 2018 under the supervision of [http://en.uestc.edu.cn/index.php?m=content&c=index&a=show&catid=79&id=5320 Prof. Yong Deng] and [http://dianzi.nwpu.edu.cn/info/1290/8224.htm Prof. Wen Jiang].  
During my undergraduate research, I was a research intern at the Hong Kong Polytechnic Unviersity [https://www.polyu.edu.hk/web/en/home/index.html (PolyU)] under the supervision of [https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ise/about/staff/20-about/staff/head-s-office/25-felix-ts-chan Prof. Felix Chan].
